# Serve static files from the "static" directory which are images
from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles

'''
With this configuration, any file in the static directory can be accessed via a URL like:
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/images/Cat-Litter-Pellet-Litter-Angle-5copy_2000x.jpg in the browser of the machine in which server is running.

These image paths will be stored in the database and used in the frontend to display the images. However,
we only store the relative path according to the static directory. For example:
'images/product123.jpg' -> relative path according to the static directory in the backend directory.
