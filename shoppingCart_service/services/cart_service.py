'''
- Total Cost Calculation -> when we have the products table, we can calculate the total cost of the items in the cart.
- Detailed Cart Item View: Expand the get_cart method to return more detailed information about each item, such as the product name, price, description, and image URL
- applying discount to the cart when we have the discount table
- Cart Expiry maybe?
- Custom Sorting Options: Allow users to view and sort items in the cart (e.g., by price, popularity, etc.), which can be handy for larger shopping lists.
-  Add a prepare_checkout endpoint that checks for item availability and locks stock temporarily to prevent overselling.
